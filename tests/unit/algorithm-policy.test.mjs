// The approved-algorithm policy, checked as a unit (REQUIREMENTS §8).
//
// Iteration 01 recorded this allowlist as a deviation rather than shipping it,
// because `alg` was not observable and a policy field for it would have been a
// control that did nothing. oid4vc-service now reports the algorithms it observed
// as `algs`, so these tests are about the control actually biting — including the
// cases that are easy to get wrong: an ABSENT algorithm and a MALFORMED one, both
// of which must be refusals rather than passes.
