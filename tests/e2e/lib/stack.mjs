/**
 * Creates the "valid credential from an untrusted issuer" fixture if it is not

 * appears in the wallet's issuer directory beside the real credential — which is
 * exactly the thing a customer-facing stack must not show. Provisioning it here
 * keeps the fixture inside the test that needs it.
 *
 * Four details are load-bearing and were each found the hard way:
 *   - `status: 'PUBLISHED'` — a draft schema is invisible to oid4vci-configs.
 *   - `oid4vciEnabled` / `oid4vciFormats` — a plausible `enabled`/`formats` is
 *     silently ignored and the credential never becomes issuable.
 *   - `vct` must be the bare slug; an absolute URL makes /vct/<slug> 404, and
 *     Credo fetches that document to render the credential.
 *   - every display entry needs a `locale`, or a wallet fetching the type
 *     metadata fails with nothing more useful than "something went wrong".
 *
 * Deprecating rather than deleting means each run that finds none creates a new
 * schema row (the registry assigns its own `did:schema:` id, so the authored
 * `$id` is not a unique key). Deprecated rows are invisible to
 * `oid4vci-configs` and to issuer metadata, which is the property that matters.
 *
 * The vct is deliberately IDENTICAL to the real credential's: that is what makes
 * the trust test real. DCQL matches on vct, upstream verification finds a
 * genuinely valid signature, and the only thing that rejects the presentation is
 * the verifier's trust allowlist.
