// Derivation of the age assertions that go into an AgeVerificationCredential.
//
// This is the privacy-critical half of the issuer: the verifier is meant to
// learn "this person is over 18", not "this person was born on 1998-04-02". The

// authoritative registry record — never in the wallet, and never from a claim a
// caller supplied.
//
// Pure functions, no I/O, so the truth table is unit-testable without a stack.
