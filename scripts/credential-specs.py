"""Credential schema specs for scripts/bootstrap.sh.

A file rather than heredocs inside bootstrap.sh: six credentials with real
claim descriptions is far more text than a shell script can carry legibly, and
bash 3.2 (still the default on macOS) cannot parse a heredoc inside $(...) in a
function body at all.

Usage: credential-specs.py <age|farmer|land|school|college|university> <author-did> <vct-slug>
Prints one JSON spec for scripts/bootstrap.sh's create_schema.

    # Three credentials from three authorities that have never heard of each
    # other. Every one of them carries `learnerId` and NOT `nationalId`: the
    # National ID is each issuer's own lookup key and must never reach a verifier
    # (REQUIREMENTS §7), while learnerId is the only thing the three have in
    # common and therefore the only thing correlation can be built on.
    #
    # `percentage` is present on all three because the Master's rule needs all
    # three. The job rule needs only the University one, and the job portal simply
    # does not ask for the other two — disclosure is decided per request, not by
    # issuing two versions of a certificate.
