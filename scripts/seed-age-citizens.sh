# Seeds synthetic AgeCitizen records into the registry.
#
# Idempotent — re-running reports what is already present. Every record is
# invented; there is no real person here, and PRODUCT forbids real data.
#
# Two kinds of fixture, deliberately:
#
#   * Fixed dates of birth for the main cases, so the demo tells the same story
#     every time it is run.
#   * COMPUTED dates for the two boundary cases. "Turns 18 today" cannot be
#     expressed as a constant — a fixed date drifts into "turned 18 years ago"
#     and stops testing the boundary at all. The property is what must be
#     repeatable, not the literal value. Exact-boundary arithmetic is also
#     covered with frozen dates in tests/unit/age-claims.test.mjs.
